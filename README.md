# Support ukraine üá∫üá¶

This is a site for getting information on how to provide support for Ukraine or seek help as a person affected by the war.

The site crowdsources managing listed causes, translating the site and developing it further.

## Crowdsourcing üë•

The project relies on the community to maintain the project and develop it further. You can take part here in Github, by sharing the site or if you want to be more involved you can contact the maintainers‚úåüèª

The context and plans of the site are explained in [the Figjam file](https://www.figma.com/file/iOKKfVYC4YMgrUfDyewCYN/Support-ukraine?node-id=0%3A1) which is used for collaborating on the project. The Figjam file is open for comments!

### Adding a new cause to the site

Add a new object to either [give_causes.json](data/give_causes.json) or [seek_causes.json](data/seek_causes.json) depending on who the cause is meant for.

`nameId` is used in translation files for defining that causes name. `descriptionId` is used to define a one or two sentence explanation of the cause. `link` is a direct link to the cause.

Add translations for the cause `nameId` and `descriptionId` by adding text content for each present translation file in [lang](lang) folder.

### Adding a new language to the site

Add a new locale to [next.config.js](next.config.js). The locale format [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) should be used.

Add a `json` file with the name of the locale to [lang](lang). Copy the `json` content from [en.json](lang/en.json) and translate the text content for the new language.

## Tech Stack üíª

The application is built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

The user interface of the application is styled using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The data is stored in json files under [data](data) and [lang](lang). This allows saving the data in a transparent way compared to a CMS or database. It also allows collaboration on those data sources without much prerequisites.
