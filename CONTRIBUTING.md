# Welcome to the contributing guide

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the site or something that could be improved, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open [a new issue](https://github.com/PetroSilenius/support-ukraine/issues/new). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/PetroSilenius/support-ukraine/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Follow the [How to run](https://github.com/PetroSilenius/support-ukraine#how-to-run) section of the README.
Optionally you can fork the repository to make sure your changes don't affect the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

3. Commit the changes once you are happy with them

4. When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

#### Pull requests
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a maintainer will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The team thanks you :sparkles:. 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [supportukraine.netlify.app](https://supportukraine.netlify.app).
